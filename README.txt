This program reads in input from a file which contains: available ingredients, dish names, and the dish recipes.
The available ingredients are comma separated (no spaces unless multiple word ingredient) on the first line of the
input file. Every line after the first contains the dish name, followed by a colon, followed by the ingredients
(once again comma separated). This program uses classes and objects in C++ along with set theory implementations.

To compile the code in linux:
make

And to run the code:
make run

To remove any created files from compiling:
make clean


Once the program is ran, the only input needed is the file name that contains ingredients and dishes.
